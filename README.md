Trakr
=====

Apps I wrote for the Spy Video Trakr programmable tank (no longer available), which was a tank-tracked remote control vehicle with an embedded camera, and was programmable in C, albeit with some difficulty due to lack of good documentation.  

This area is more of a museum than an active development project, although it remains a very interesting platform and I may yet come back to it.

Projects included
-----------------

* BigTrakr - this app lets the user program the tank in a sequence of steps, reminiscent of the old 80s toy Big Trak.
* BattleTracker - a wire-frame graphics implementation of a Battlezone-like game, which mixes real movement with overlaid 3D virtual obstacles to avoid - plus that pesky enemy tank, of course.
* Surveillance - drive the tank to an observation location and set it to monitor the area - any intrusion is met with an alarm (which you can record), plus taking a picture as evidence.
