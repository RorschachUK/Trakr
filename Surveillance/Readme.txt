Surveillance v1.0 by RorschachUK September 2011
A motion-sensor security app for Trakr
Requires SD card

Overview
========
A motion-sensor security application which uses your Trakr's camera
to watch for movement.  If it spots something moving, it will play
an alarm you can record in advance, it will also take a picture of
the scene and record a few seconds of audio as evidence.  Drive
back to base and you can find the evidence photo and audio on the
SD card by connecting to your PC!

Instructions
============
Install the app by copying Surveillance.bin to the APPs directory
on the Trakr's SD card.

When the app is started, and the button under the word 'Start' is
pressed, you will be in 'Move' mode.  In this mode, move around
until you find the spot you want to guard.  Your choices are to
either press button 1 to enter Record mode, to record an alarm
sound, or press button 2 to enter Guard mode.

If you go into Record mode, some instructions will show on the
screen.  To record an alarm message, push and hold the button on
the front of the Trakr, speak your message whilst keeping the
button pushed, and when you're done, let go of the button.  If
all has gone well, the Trakr will play your message back to you.

If you go into Guard mode, the Trakr will stop moving and will
begin watching intently the scene in front of it.  A bar graph 
shown along the bottom of the screen shows how different it thinks
the picture is from when it started watching.  When something 
moves wnough to trip the sensor, it will play the alarm you
recorded, and will take a picture and record a few seconds of
audio to store as evidence.  It then returns to Move mode so you
can drive it back to base to retrieve the evidence.

To find the evidence the Trakr recorded, connect your Trakr to
your PC, find the Trakr's SD card amongst the PC's drives, and
navigate to the Surveillance directory.  Your evidence photo and
audio will be stored there!
